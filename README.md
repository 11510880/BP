This package is for belief-propgation(BP) decoding of Low-Density Lattice Code(LDLC).

There are two unittest cases in the /test folder. 
User can run **test_variable_node_function.py** for testing variable_node_function.
And **test_ldlc_decoder.py** is for testing BP decoding, 
where a check matrix with n=8, d=3 was used.
